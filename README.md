This project focuses on predicting customer churn using data mining, using machine learning 
approaches to gather important insights and optimize decision-making procedures. Customer 
churn, or the loss of consumers over time, is a major worry for businesses since it directly affects 
profitability and long-term growth. Understanding the elements that influence turnover allows 
firms to build targeted tactics to retain customers, improve satisfaction, and optimize operations. 
 
The study begins with the selection of a suitable customer churn dataset, followed by rigorous data 
preprocessing, which includes resolving missing values, converting data types, and addressing 
class imbalances. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is used to identify patterns, trends, and 
correlations between variables, followed by the development and optimization of prediction 
models.  
The Random Forest Classifier, which has been improved by hyperparameter tweaking and cross
validation, is the best-performing model for predicting churn. Finally, based on the insights 
collected, meaningful business recommendations are presented to assist the organization in 
reducing churn and improving decision-making.
